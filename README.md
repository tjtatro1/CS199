This is a collection of three games I created for my CS199: Game Design class at UIUC. They were created according to a set of loose 
guidelines, but most of the design decisions were left up to me. Here are the links where you can play all three games:

<a href="https://tjtatro1.github.io/CS199/RollABallv2/">Roll a Ball</a>

<a href="https://tjtatro1.github.io/CS199/SpaceShooterV1/">Space Shooter</a> (My scope was way too big for this one. Therefore, it is buggy and unfinished.)

<a href="https://tjtatro1.github.io/CS199/RollABallv2/">Tanks</a> (I have the graphics set to max on this game, so it may run at a low framerate on your computer.)
